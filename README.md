# Recommender-Sentiment-Analysis
I have done this project during my summer internship in data science and machine learning
In this project I have done analysis on the dataset of clothes rating and reviews. Using sentiment analysis on the review text to get an actual score from text and from that score I have generated recommendations for a specific product. Recommendations were generated using K-nearest neighbor.
It is my first time ever working on machine learning algorithms.
